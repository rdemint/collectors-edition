Collectors edition is an idea. A philosphy. A journey.  

I write this here so that you can better understand the sought after and highly regarded boulders I describe on this site.  I hope you can take away inspiration and create your own list that pulls you into transformative adventures.

Quality over quantity, in it's essence. Because life is short, and the experiences we have on this earth are limited. 
If we are to make it meaningful, we are to make the most of it.  With that in mind, we try to seek out experiences that better us and develop character. 

Those experiences are not the easiest ones.  They are the experiences that encompass the whole experiene and emotion of life itself.  There is challenge, progress, pain, and joy. 

## Aesthetics
The color and the patterns in the rock as well as the overall shape and positioning of the boulder in the landscape, collectively contribut the most to qualifying as CE (collectors edition).  I'm always surprised just how rare amazing boulders are.  How they landed at just the right angle to have a landing, and steepness, to be climbable at all. 
I will risk and work much harder for the truly unique and rare boulders.  It connects me and reminds me to seek out the

## Angle
A boulder cannot by definition by CE unless it is vertical or steeper.  

What does not qualify a boulder as CE? 
- happens to exists at a popular climbing area, and the large amount of travel gives it more 'hype'
- four stars in a guidebook.  Guidebook stars are often relative to an area.
Don't get me wrong, I love circuiting too and there is a time and place for that.  I don't want to go on epic missions on the time.  I also want to just be able to appreciate the simplicity and movement of going climbing. 
The higher barrier to entry to CE boulders has it's downside, but the extra effort is consistently worth it to me.
