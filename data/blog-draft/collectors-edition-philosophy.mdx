Collectors edition is an idea. A philosophy. A journey.  

Quality over quantity, in it's essence. Because life is short, and the experiences we have on this earth are limited. 
If we are to make it meaningful, we are to make the most of it.  With that in mind, we try to seek out experiences that better us and develop character. 

Those experiences are not the easiest ones.  They are the experiences that encompass the whole experiene and emotion of life itself.  There is challenge, progress, pain, and joy. 

## Collectors edition criteria 

### Aesthetics
The color and the patterns in the rock as well as the overall shape and positioning of the boulder in the landscape, collectively contribut the most to qualifying as CE (collectors edition).  I'm always surprised just how rare amazing boulders are.  How they landed at just the right angle to have a landing, and steepness, to be climbable at all. 
I will risk and work much harder for the truly unique and rare boulders.  It connects me and reminds me to seek out the

### Angle
A boulder cannot by definition by CE unless it is vertical or steeper.  

What does not qualify a boulder as CE? 
- happens to exists at a popular climbing area, and the large amount of travel gives it more 'hype'
- four stars in a guidebook.  Guidebook stars are often relative to an area.
Don't get me wrong, I love circuiting too and there is a time and place for that.  I don't want to go on epic missions on the time.  I also want to just be able to appreciate the simplicity and movement of going climbing. 
The higher barrier to entry to CE boulders has it's downside, but the extra effort is consistently worth it to me.

## Why this site, though?
Mountainproject and similar apps aren't very personal, and it is always more special to me to come across some individual's site, blog, or mini-guide and uncover some unique beta. 
Back when I was in Tucson, AZ, there was a locals site called <a href="http://oldpueblobouldering.com">Old Pueblo Bouldering</a>.  I always thought it was so much cooler than mountainproject, and it had local personality.  Though admitedly terribly slow, it opened too many adventures for me to count. It's quirks made it a bit more special.
In addition, there was a mythical PDF guide that was passed around for Wilderness of Rocks bouldering.  It took me a while to get my hands on it, but when I did the it felt like Christmas. Of course I printed it out on physical paper to have an almost-real guidebook. 
Being forced to reach out or benefit from a particular community members for home-grown guides and beta is a good thing in my opinion, because it builds community.  Having moved from the east coast, to Arizona, to Tahoe, I know what it's like being an outsider and having to work your way in. Some of the connections and friendships I have built by touring or getting a tour of an area, not to mention developing an area, I absolutely treasure.  Mountainproject, however convenient, is not the end-all-be-all.  The data is not truly owned by the community (just read their data use and scraping policy), and I will never put another route on MP or similar again.
